# James Ellis' Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi. This repository contains examples of SQL and Python I've written whilst working through various data analysis courses, alongside visualizations in both Tableau and Power BI. Feel free to take a look around and reach out if you have any feedback or questions.

# Projects

## Bicycle Sales Analysis Project

- Description: Utilizing sales data to create informative visual dashboards.
- Tools Utilized: **SQL, Excel, and Tableau**
- Task: Fictional task to analyze a bicycle store's sales data between 2016 and 2019.

**Task Overview:**
* Purpose: Improved sales reporting for the years 2016-2019 onwards.
* Plan: Convert static data to visual dashboards (accessibility), including data for sales year 2016-2019, revenues per region, per store, per product category, per brand, alongside two lists of top customers and top sales reps. Then connect the modified SQL database directly to Excel (via the linked SQL query) so that updates can carried across. Create both Excel and Tableau dashboards as visualization examples.
* Necessary Systems: SQL, Excel, and Tableau
* Relevant Info: SQL Database

## Tableau Dashboard Examples

**Airlines Dashboard**

I approached the data as follows. Firstly, a dashboard covering a general overview of the data pertaining to general questions: What are the averages relating to reviews per customer type and reviews per seat/class type, and what percentage of each makes up the total customer base.

Secondly, I created a further dashboard to hone in on the previous general metrics but in relation to Aegean and their immediate competitors. Allowing them to see their relative positions against the first dashboard's general data and their competitors.

Third and finally, I created a final dashboard that includes further filterable variables (food rating, staff rating, entertainment rating, and value for money rating) that allow one the ability to filter the data as to perceive which actionable changes (better food, entertainment, etc) relate to higher average reviews and a greater number of recommendations.

These three dashboards are then presented as a full story that, in a real-life scenario, would be accompanied by a presentation.
